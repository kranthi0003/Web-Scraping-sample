# Web-Scraping-sample
This repository comes up with a single & simple python file consisting of Webscraping & Notification tool which scraps my friend's data from a coding website and reports/notifies to my pc, their no. of submissions and no. of correct submissions kinda stuff.I feel bored when I don't visit their profile once atleast a day.Then I started thinking of Webscraping and notifications which automate my process so that I can spy them {LOL} within a matter of seconds,without my daily effort.

modules used:

1: Requests
2: bs4 - Beautiful Soup
3: notify2
4: time
